ofxRx
=====

This is an openframeworks addon to bridge [rxcpp](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxCpp)

This addon REQUIRES the [C++11](https://github.com/openFrameworks-cpp11/openFrameworks) version of openframeworks. After cloning openframeworks and ofxRx (into the addons dir) use the projectgenerator project to update the examples. For Osx the generated example projects must be edited to compile for 10.9 and c++11 before building.

There are two examples that demonstrate mouse, keyboard and update streams.
